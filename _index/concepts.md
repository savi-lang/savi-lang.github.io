In this section, you'll be introduced to the core concepts in Savi that we'll refer to throughout the rest of the documentation.

Your goal here should be to get a broad mental map of these concepts, then refine and solidify your understanding by reading the other sections.

You may already be familiar with some of these concepts from experience with other languages, but it's important to start to map out how they relate to Savi in particular.
